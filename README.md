## Signal Visualization with Enhanced Color Patterns and Timestamps

The `visualize_sft_measurements` function processes and displays signals with improved clarity using unique color patterns and timestamps. Here's an overview of its features:

### Color Patterns
- **Original Signals**: Represented with neon colors for easy identification.
- **Adjusted Magnitudes**: Denoted with darker colors to distinguish from the original signals.

### Timestamps
- **Start and End Points**: Clearly marked with timestamps at the bottom of the chart, indicating when each signal starts and ends.
- **Indicators**: Small markers placed outside the timestamp area highlight the exact start and stop points for precision.

### Improved.py File
The `improved.py` file is the newer version of this implementation, incorporating the enhancements mentioned above. This version ensures a better visualization experience by avoiding overlap and providing clear, distinct annotations for each signal.

By using distinct colors and clear timestamp annotations, the visualization provides a comprehensive and visually appealing overview of the signal data, making it easier to understand patterns and variations.


### Patterns and Green Dot Measurement

1. **Signal Processing**:
   - Signals from the `stored_signals` dictionary are processed using the `sft` function, which calculates the Short-time Fourier Transform (SFT) of each signal.

2. **Magnitude Adjustment**:
   - The `adjust_magnitude` function is applied to the calculated SFT magnitudes. If a magnitude is greater than 3, it is adjusted using a factor of 1.30. If it is less than or equal to 3, it is adjusted using a factor of 1.20.

3. **Plotting**:
   - The original signals are plotted as either solid or faint lines based on their classification (important or background).
   - The adjusted magnitudes are then plotted as green dots at their respective positions on the graph. This was done using `ax.plot([frequencies[i]], [adjusted_magnitude], 'go')`, where `'go'` specifies green dots.

### Updated Green Line Pattern Measurement

In the updated approach, the green line pattern replaces the green dots. Here's how it works:

1. **Signal Processing**:
   - As before, signals from `stored_signals` are processed using the `sft` function to obtain their SFT magnitudes.

2. **Magnitude Adjustment**:
   - The `adjust_magnitude` function adjusts the magnitudes.

3. **Plotting**:
   - Original signals are plotted with the same visual distinction between important and background data.
   - The adjusted magnitudes are then plotted as a connected green line using `ax.plot(frequencies, adjusted_magnitudes, color='green', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, label=f"{name} (Adjusted)")`.

### Comparison of Process:
1. **Original**:
   - Each adjusted magnitude was represented as an individual green dot.
   - Easier to see individual points where the adjustments were applied but did not connect the points.

2. **Updated**:
   - Adjusted magnitudes are represented as a continuous green line.
   - Provides a clearer, continuous visual representation of how the magnitudes change across the signal, making it easier to see trends and patterns.

### Purpose:
- Both the original green dots and the updated green line serve to highlight the adjusted magnitudes compared to the original signals. They help in visualizing how the signal's amplitude is altered by the magnitude adjustment.
