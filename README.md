### Patterns and Green Dot Measurement

1. **Signal Processing**:
   - Signals from the `stored_signals` dictionary are processed using the `sft` function, which calculates the Short-time Fourier Transform (SFT) of each signal.

2. **Magnitude Adjustment**:
   - The `adjust_magnitude` function is applied to the calculated SFT magnitudes. If a magnitude is greater than 3, it is adjusted using a factor of 1.30. If it is less than or equal to 3, it is adjusted using a factor of 1.20.

3. **Plotting**:
   - The original signals are plotted as either solid or faint lines based on their classification (important or background).
   - The adjusted magnitudes are then plotted as green dots at their respective positions on the graph. This was done using `ax.plot([frequencies[i]], [adjusted_magnitude], 'go')`, where `'go'` specifies green dots.

### Updated Green Line Pattern Measurement

In the updated approach, the green line pattern replaces the green dots. Here's how it works:

1. **Signal Processing**:
   - As before, signals from `stored_signals` are processed using the `sft` function to obtain their SFT magnitudes.

2. **Magnitude Adjustment**:
   - The `adjust_magnitude` function adjusts the magnitudes.

3. **Plotting**:
   - Original signals are plotted with the same visual distinction between important and background data.
   - The adjusted magnitudes are then plotted as a connected green line using `ax.plot(frequencies, adjusted_magnitudes, color='green', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, label=f"{name} (Adjusted)")`.

### Comparison of Process:
1. **Original**:
   - Each adjusted magnitude was represented as an individual green dot.
   - Easier to see individual points where the adjustments were applied but did not connect the points.

2. **Updated**:
   - Adjusted magnitudes are represented as a continuous green line.
   - Provides a clearer, continuous visual representation of how the magnitudes change across the signal, making it easier to see trends and patterns.

### Purpose:
- Both the original green dots and the updated green line serve to highlight the adjusted magnitudes compared to the original signals. They help in visualizing how the signal's amplitude is altered by the magnitude adjustment.
